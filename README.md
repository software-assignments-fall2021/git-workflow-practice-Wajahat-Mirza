# Response to the assignment
1. [TradeRepublic Website](https://traderepublic.com/en-de) is an investment platform in the EU that I absolutely love! Just look at their homepage.

What I absolutely admire about the website is the UI and UX. For instance, look at the staircase design on the homepage - whether someone is a guest user or a regular visitor, it just keeps you engaged and mesmerized. On top of it, what surprises me even more is the robustness of the website. With such complicated design flow, one could expect the website to be a bit slower. But nah - TradeRepublic knows what they are doing!

2. I opened up following Pull Request - [PR](https://github.com/software-students-fall2021/git-workflow-practice-tazasahar/pull/4) at Taza's repo.

## Lauren Gatesman's Comments
The website has really cool design elements and is very smooth, and most importantly easy to use. I especially like the "staircase" element that moves as you scroll down the page. The website is simple and inviting, which is great. Also, I was surprised to see that they have 4,000 savings plans that users can choose from! Overall seems like a great site and idea, especially for young college students.
