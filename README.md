1. [TradeRepublic Website](https://traderepublic.com/en-de) is an investment platform in the EU that I absolutely love! Just look at their homepage.

What I absolutely admire about the website is the UI and UX. For instance, look at the staircase design on the homepage - whether someone is a guest user or a regular visitor, it just keeps you engaged and mesmerized. On top of it, what surprises me even more is the robustness of the website. With such complicated design flow, one could expect the website to be a bit slower. But nah - TradeRepublic knows what they are doing!
